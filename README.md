# vim-react-snippets

If you use Vim as your text editor, this extension provides you JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7.

If comming from vs-code, and and develop with the react framework, you must have find some hardship finding somethig that replace de "vscode-es7-javascript-react-snippets". 

Well, my way to fix it was to made my own snippets. that I cold easyly reconfigurate later as soon as I want.

This pluggin depends of the "UltiSnips" pluggin. https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips
